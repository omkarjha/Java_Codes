# Java Object-Oriented Programming Examples

Welcome to my Java object-oriented programming repository! This repository houses Java code examples and projects that I completed during my 5th semester at [Your College Name]. The projects here are designed to illustrate key concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Contents

- **Inheritance Examples:** Explore how classes can inherit attributes and behaviors from parent classes.
- **Polymorphism Demonstrations:** See how Java supports polymorphic behavior through method overriding and interfaces.
- **Encapsulation:** Examples showcasing data hiding and access control.
- **Abstraction in Practice:** Learn how abstraction helps in managing complexity by hiding unnecessary details.



## Getting Started

To get started with these examples, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omkarjha/Java_Codes.git
